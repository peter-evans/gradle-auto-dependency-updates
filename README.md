# Automating Gradle dependency updates with GitHub Actions
[![CI](https://github.com/peter-evans/gradle-auto-dependency-updates/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/peter-evans/gradle-auto-dependency-updates/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

Using Gradle's [dependency locking](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_locking.html) feature we can create an automated process to periodically create a pull request for dependency updates.

See an [example pull request](https://github.com/peter-evans/gradle-auto-dependency-updates/pull/2) to update the dependencies of the example app in this repository.

## Configuring dependency locking

1. Firstly, make sure the gradle wrapper is up to date. This is necessary in order to use the feature preview in the next step.

    ```
    gradle wrapper --gradle-version 6.5
    ```

2. Enable the `ONE_LOCKFILE_PER_PROJECT` feature preview in *settings.gradle.kts*. You can read more about this feature [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_locking.html#single_lock_file_per_project).

    ```
    rootProject.name = "example-api"

    enableFeaturePreview("ONE_LOCKFILE_PER_PROJECT")
    ```

3. Add the following section to *build.gradle.kts* to version lock all configurations. See the [documentation here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_locking.html#enabling_locking_on_configurations) if you would like to customise this for specific configurations.

    ```
    dependencyLocking {
        lockAllConfigurations()
    }
    ```

4. **Optionally**, add the following if you would like to create a lockfile for the `buildscript` section. This can be used to version lock plugins.

    ```diff
    buildscript {
        repositories {
            mavenCentral()
            jcenter()
        }
        dependencies {
            classpath("com.jfrog.bintray.gradle:gradle-bintray-plugin:1.8.+")
        }
    +    configurations.classpath {
    +        resolutionStrategy.activateDependencyLocking()
    +    }
    }

    apply(plugin = "com.jfrog.bintray")
    ```

5. Write a `gradle.lockfile` for your current dependencies. If you followed step 4, you will also have a `buildscript-gradle.lockfile`.

    ```
    ./gradlew dependencies --write-locks
    ```

6. Check the lockfiles into source control. The lockfiles will now make sure that `./gradlew build` uses strict versions from the lockfile.

7. Specify [version ranges](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/single_versions.html) for your dependencies. The range should include all versions that you are happy to accept version updates for. For example, `1.2.+` for just patch updates, `1.+` for minor updates, and `+` to include major version updates.

## Automate dependency updates

Add the following GitHub Actions workflow to periodically create a pull request containing dependency updates.
The following example uses the [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request) action and executes once a week.

Note that if you want pull requests created by this action to trigger checks then a repo scoped [PAT](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) should be used instead of the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
It is *highly recommended* to make sure checks run and build the new pull request in CI.
This will verify that the dependency versions in the new lockfile will build and pass tests.

```yml
name: Update Dependencies
on:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 1 * * 1'
jobs:
  update-dep:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-java@v1
        with:
          java-version: 1.8
      - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
        run: chmod +x gradlew
      - name: Perform dependency resolution and write new lockfiles
        run: ./gradlew dependencies --write-locks
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v2
        with:
            token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
            commit-message: Update dependencies
            title: Update dependencies
            body: |
              - Dependency updates
  
              Auto-generated by [create-pull-request][1]
  
              [1]: https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request
            branch: update-dependencies
```
